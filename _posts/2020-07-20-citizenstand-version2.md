Please welcome the Citizen Stand 2.0 made for going to do your part as a citizen.

This is the Citizen Stand 2.0 with what I learned from my first version. Now the holder for the phone is 3d printed with a rubber tension to keep the phone pulled tight. THe pole is now power coated black. And, the top has a standard camera mount for a camera like my 360 degree one.

Feedback is welcome! This one I accepted the donation of $120 USD because it takes me 3 hours plus materials to make this. This cost is not fixed and should be more like $160. However, it would be great to get the cost down so more people may take a stand, a Citizen Stand :)
