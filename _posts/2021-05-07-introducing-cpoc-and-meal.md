Hi, its Chris. What a year! I'm making progress. In addition to my personal website, I have my for-profit business, MEAL, or Madison Equipment And Lumber, and have setup my non-profit, CPOC, which stands for COMBAT POVERTY ORGANIZE COMMUNITY.

I setup a simple website for these endeavors and will keep adding to them.
