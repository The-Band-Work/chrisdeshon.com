## About Citizen Stand

Citizen Stand is a project...

## The Problems

- No one is using. Only me :(.
- Not understood what it will do.
- No goal on where it can grow.
- No good photos of it in action.
- To make one costs $20 in materials and 3 hours. I'm not sure how much to charge. Ideas?
- No story about where this project may grow.

## The Solution

- Buy one. Current Cost: USD $160. Summer '20 Promotion: $120. <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=Buy Citizen Stand Now">Buy Now</a>.
- Make one.
- Cost down production so may be more easily produced, used.
- Share your public notes and city council proceedings (maybe we need a site to do this? or use archive.org?)
